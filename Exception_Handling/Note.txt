# exception handling:- 
--------------------------
--------------------------
* Exception is noting but the error occuring in the program and while running the program.
* Exception Handling is nothing but converting the technical errors to user friendly messages.
* Errors are of 3 types:
        a. Compile Time errors:- Occurs due to wrong syntaxes and occurs during compilation time.
        b. Logical Error:- Occurs due to wrong representation logics and occurs during runtime.
        c. Runtime Error:- Occurs due to invalid inputs and occurs at runtime.
* Exceptions are of two types:
        a. Inbuilt Exceptions:- Already defined by language programmers.
                    i) zeroDivisionError
                    ii) ValueError
                    iii) IndexError
                    IV) KeyError
                    V) Attribute Error
        b. User-Defined Exceptions:- Developed by programmers and present in the python file.
                    i) Attempting to invalid pin
                    ii) Invalid Userid and password
                    iii) Withdrawing more amount then present amount

* 4 Keywords for handling the exceptions:-
        i) try: It is a block of statements where exceptions occurs. Every try block haves its own except block.
                        try:
                                stmts-----
                        except:
                                stmts-----
        ii) except: It is a block of statements generates user-friendly message.
        iii) else: It will execute when there is no error in the try block. Its an optional block.
                        try:
                                stmts-----
                        except:
                                stmts-----
                        else:
                                stmts-----
        iv) Finally: It is a block which will runs compulsory either there is error or there is not a error.
                        try:
                                stmts-----
                        except:
                                stmts-----
                        else:
                                stmts-----
                        finally:
                                stmts-----
                
   * Various forms of except block:
   1) Single except block handling one exception at a time.
    try:
        ---stmts-----                             
    except Exception_class_name_1:
        --- stmts---
        ---generates user friendly message---
    try:
        ---stmts-----                             
    except Exception_class_name_2:
        --- stmts---
        ---generates user friendly message---
        |
        |
        |
    try:
        ---stmts-----                             
    except Exception_class_name_n:
        --- stmts---
        ---generates user friendly message---

    2) Single except block handling one exception at a time.
    try:
        ---stmts-----                             
    except(Exception_class_name_1,Exception_class_name_2,------,Exception_class_name_n):
        ---userfriendly message for Exception_class_name_1,
        ---userfriendly message for Exception_class_name_2,
        |
        |
        |
        ---userfriendly message for Exception_class_name_n
